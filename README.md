NDN DeLorean: An Authentication System for Data Archives in Named Data Networking
=================================================================================

Named Data Networking (NDN) enables data-centric security in network communication by mandating digital signatures on network-layer data packets.
Since the lifetime of some data can extend to many years, they out-live the lifetime of their signatures.

*NDN DeLorean* is an authentication framework to ensure the long-term authenticity of long-lived data, taking a publicly auditable bookkeeping service approach to keep permanent proofs of data signatures and the times the signatures were generated.
